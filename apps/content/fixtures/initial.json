I love the carol \"How Great My Joy\" that has the antiphonal chorus between choir and congregation. Another great opening song is \"Jesus, What a Wonderful Child\" that is published by Hope Publishing in SATB or SAB arrangements. It has been recorded by Mississippi Mass Choir, Dottie Peoples, Mariah Carey, and even Gladys Knight. Listen to their renditions for tempo; tempo is very important in gospel music, and the Hope Publishing demo is too fast!</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Add some Christmas themed gospel choir tunes</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>After an invocation and welcome, we'll rip into Norman Hutchins' \"He Has Come\" from his album \"Emmanuel\" on JDI Records and available at Amazon MP3. There are several great gospel Christmas jams on that album including the title cut and \"Jesus Born on This Day.\" All three of these tunes are familiar to fans of gospel music and will start you off right. This entire album is available in print from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ntimemusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.ntimemusic.com</a>. I suggest that you get several of the song books and teach the songs by ear to the choir.</p>\r\n<p>After \"He Has Come\" we'll feature a challenging arrangement of \"What Child is This\" from the collection \"Great Joy\" by Broadway Inspirational Voices. Some of the best talent in New York sing with this all star gospel choir, and the songbook has the arrangements perfectly rendered&nbsp;with the bass part added.&nbsp;If you haven't heard the album, check it out on Spotify and you will hear some of the best Christmas gospel I have ever heard. Both the CD and songbook are at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ntimemusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.ntimemusic.com</a>&nbsp;also, or you can get it from BIV website. We try to do one or two of these each year, since they are pretty difficult and offer our choir a challenge.</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Use special ensembles for women or men</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>One thing we like to do at NCF-Glenwood is include a song by our women and a song by the men. \"Rejoice\" by Richard Smallwood is a great tune for a women's chorus, from Smallwood's songbook/album \"Rejoice\" available on Amazon.com.</p>\r\n<p>This year we're having our women sing \"You Brought the Sunshine\" by the Clark Sisters, a well-known black gospel women's group. Our men sang Wayne Watson's \"Child of Bethlehem\" two years ago (arr Marty Parks/Lillenas Pub), \"This Christmas\" by Donny Hathaway last year (<a href=\"http://donnyhathawayblogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">donnyhathawayblogspot.com</a>), and this year we're looking at the Temptations' arrangement of \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\"! Since a Christmas concert is not a worship service at our church, we like to mix in soul pop classics.</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Invite instrumental participation</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>We have an eclectic group of instrumentalists at our church, and I like to include them, especially string players on 1 or 2 of the pieces. The difficulty here is that with 3 violinists, 1 horn, 2 saxes, 3 trumpets, 1 clarinet, and 1 double bass, you almost have to do custom arrangements!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At NCF-Chattanooga we now have two campuses, and we share musical resources between the two congregations throughout the year. The program I am describing is focused on the Glenwood campus, and East Lake has a different emphasis. Mostly I wanted to share the resources that are out there for a fresh, soulful Christmas program. You can also find several original Christmas anthems on the CD \"I'll Be More Like Jesus\" and the sheet music is available for all of those at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jameswardmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.jameswardmusic.com</a></p>", "tags": [12, 38, 13, 37, 34, 40, 33]}}, {"pk": 49, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p class=\"p1\">As a part of searching for new Music Ministry staff at New City Fellowship of Lancaster PA, &nbsp;TE Stanley Morton created the following documents. &nbsp;They are a strong statement of vision and of the specific challenges faced in attempting cross cultural worship. &nbsp;<br /><br />We pray that their search will be fruitful.

Let the peoples praise you,&nbsp;O God; let all the peoples praise&nbsp;you! Psalm 67:1-3</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">New City Fellowship is an inner-city cross-cultural&nbsp;church that seeks to extend the gospel of grace to all of the people of&nbsp;Lancaster City.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our&nbsp;surrounding community, &nbsp;music is&nbsp;an integral part of the life of New City and&nbsp;will reflect&nbsp;a mixture of styles which are primarily from our heritage of hymns (old&nbsp;and&nbsp;new), Contemporary Christian, African, the various expressions of&nbsp;African-American Gospel, and secondarily from Hispanic, Folk, Messianic and&nbsp;Urban/Hip Hop.&nbsp;&nbsp;We celebrate the cultures&nbsp;that are already a part of us, and extend that celebration to those in our&nbsp;neighborhood we wish to reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a&nbsp;rich experience we&nbsp;can enjoy as we worship our one God through different&nbsp;musical styles and cultural expressions!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">We&nbsp;are Reformed, which means our worship is deliberately biblical, Christ&nbsp;centered, and grace oriented.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although&nbsp;the Reformed worship tradition is usually of a&nbsp;quieter type, we want our&nbsp;worship here in the city to cross cultural divides and speak to hearts of those&nbsp;who are culturally connected to the inner city sub-cultures&nbsp;of Lancaster City&nbsp;(As of the 2010 census, Lancaster city as a whole is 55% white, 40% Hispanic,&nbsp;and 16% African-American).&nbsp;&nbsp;Our worship should&nbsp;be well-prepared and executed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The&nbsp;lyrics should lead our hearts to be focused on God, who is both the subject and&nbsp;object of worship.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lyrics should teach,&nbsp;edify,&nbsp;admonish, inspire, excite, and comfort us, the body of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the music should have an&nbsp;urban and melodic groove,&nbsp;characteristic of our community.&nbsp;&nbsp;For city dwellers, the best worship music is:<br />- celebration, not just cerebralization (overly cognitive in&nbsp;content);&nbsp;<br />- participation, not only observation (clapping, shouting and the like);&nbsp;<br />- releasing, not restricting (allowing worshipers to be caught up&nbsp;emotionally in&nbsp;the worship, not just in contemplation).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />While worship is never to be governed primarily by what people want, think&nbsp;they&nbsp;need or for simply a euphoric experience, it should nevertheless speak&nbsp;with a musical voice that resonates enough with our community to provide a&nbsp;hospitable&nbsp;worship environment for them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">We&nbsp;want to imitate the urban church music progression which begins with songs that&nbsp;are celebrative, active and stir the emotions and then transition to songs&nbsp;that&nbsp;are more contemplative and thoughtful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such&nbsp;a progression could start out with a rousing gospel or contemporary Christian song&nbsp;that gets everyone up and&nbsp;on their feet, a second that maintains the momentum&nbsp;and a last song that brings worshipers into a more content filled time of&nbsp;reflection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples could be&nbsp;something&nbsp;like &ldquo;What He&rsquo;s Done for Me&rdquo; to &ldquo;I Just Want To Praise Him&rdquo; or &ldquo;God is Good&rdquo; to&nbsp;&ldquo;In Christ Alone&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">While&nbsp;some hymns and other songs have not originated in the urban tradition, they&nbsp;should be played in a manner that reflects our urban context and melodic&nbsp;groove, using the appropriate instrumentation, style, tempo, number of&nbsp;repetitions (example &ndash; version of All Hail the Power of Jesus Name).&nbsp;&nbsp;Our services can be&nbsp;characterized by all&nbsp;aspects of involvement expressed in the scriptures &ndash; instruments, tambourines,&nbsp;cymbals, hand raising, clapping, weeping, shouting and&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;dancing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The&nbsp;music should be carefully chosen, adequately rehearsed, and presented by&nbsp;musicians who have prepared themselves before God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the diversity&nbsp;of styles in our&nbsp;worship services, we will endeavor to appreciate styles that are not our&nbsp;personal favorites. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, our&nbsp;range of diversity must be sufficiently&nbsp;limited to reflect a consistent musical&nbsp;voice of the church.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">New City Fellowship&nbsp;Lancaster Music Director Job Description</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat&nbsp;appointed men to sing to the Lord and to praise him for the splendor of his&nbsp;holiness. &nbsp;

Although the seed can fall on stony ground, we had some stable, committed church planters in our music pool. Indeed, several of our musicians and singers are still with the church. In addition to my wife and myself, Lunard Lewis has been with us since 1978, Bryan Holland came in 1973, and came back in 2008, Leland Stewart, Jim and Rachel Crumble, and Joan Nabors were all among the early musical leaders.</p>\r\n<p>Not only did it help to have a pianist and song writer committed to the work, but we also had an African-American who played bass and directed a fledgling choir.  Choir days that we visited were a great point of contact with African-American churches, and helped build credibility for our mission. We learned classic gospel repertoire like <em>Praise is What I Do, </em>and <em>Order My Steps.</em> Although some have said that it is a stereotype to have a black gospel choir in a multi-cultural church, we found that it provided a much needed joyful sound in our worship that did not necessarily characterize the dominant culture music of that time. Also the creative environment of learning dynamic music kept the musicians and singers occupied and interested. Learning to reproduce gospel music with its passion, its harmonies, its message, its bass lines, and its vocal timbre is no small challenge.</p>\r\n<p>The planting and watering of a dogwood does not go without alertness and maintenance. \"Spot Anthracnose attacks flower bracts (petals) eventually spreading to leaves, shoots and fruit. Look for reddish-purple spots in early spring. A severe infection will cause flower bracts to fall prematurely.\" [savatree.com]</p>\r\n<p>We had our obstacles as well. One was that it seemed like white college students were attracted to our little church plant more than inner city folk. When we had a worship service, one could look over the group and see as many observers as members. Our emphasis on helping the poor made it hard for our services to have a very big representation of urban households. Poor people often don't have transportation and their lives are controlled by myriad problems that militate against church attendance on Sunday morning early. On the other hand, young college students were excited, well fed, and driving in to check out this experiment.</p>\r\n<p>I struggled to find singers and musicians who could get the sound we were after. Gerardo Marti, in his book <em>Worship Across the Racial Divide </em>speaks of pastors trying to find African-American soloists and worship leaders who can get that sound they are looking for. White singers must work to change their phrasing and improvisational skills to sing gospel music right. My songs were also a hybrid sound of Reformed theology and blues licks, even though I was studying and imitating black music. I guess I didn't really want to write exact replicas of Andrae Crouch's songs.</p>\r\n<p>Further, urban blacks were deeply committed to their churches, and very few wanted to break rank with their grandmother's church. Even though there were solid friendships and warm common experiences with folks, it would never replace the homogeneous sound and culture of the black experience. Eventually black Christians began to be drawn to our church from connections they had, spiritual struggles that found solace in our ministry, or inter-racial marriage. The latter continues to be an obstacle in the life of a couple that seeks a worshiping body that both can relate to. But today, our music is much more developed and visiting black attendees are more inclined to feel included in the cultural mix of a service.</p>\r\n<p>Another obstacle was the dingy places we had to worship at first. The old YMCA we met in was convenient and cheap, but it was grimy and poorly secured. There was the risk of PA systems, keyboards, or computers. Later, when we met at a Christian school, it was cleaner, but outside the perceived target area of our ministry. As our church grew, we needed a bigger place, and our set-up on Sundays became more demanding. For me personally, I experienced my first burn-out from setting up the PA system, drums, keys, and even risers for the choir, and then leading in worship.</p>\r\n<p>Issues come up as the music ministry becomes more elaborate. Those who are faithful and become invested in the work begin to feel like they should be rewarded, when they may not actually have the talents necessary for leadership in singing or playing. The volunteers from the dominant culture begin to question whether there is any benefit to them and to their families, when so much of the work is specifically directed to the minority.</p>\r\n<p>We prayed for a better place to meet, and Dr. John Sanderson of Covenant College began to pray for us to move into our present location in Glenwood. For the music department, moving into a traditional space brought new challenges. At first our band was down in front of the pulpit and the room was not conducive to amplified music. Almost every Sunday we struggled with the overwhelming bass resonance and the acoustic drums drowning out the choir.</p>\r\n<p>A third obstacle was the skepticism and discomfort from the denomination and the Presbytery. Church growth models at the time were based on homogeneous growth and PCAs were being planted in shiny new subdivisions. Demographic uniformity was the plan of the day, and Willow Creek Community Church was one of many churches planted and grown after the missiology of C. Peter Wagner of Fuller Seminary. The idea of an intentionally diverse congregation being planted in a southern town was not unheard of in 1971, but it was not as strongly supported in the PCA as it has become today.</p>\r\n<p>Our music choices, our instrumentation, our vocal sound, and our blues-gospel style was one that separated me personally from other white musicians in town as well as fellow recording artists at my record company. This choice made our church music less welcoming to other congregations in Chattanooga in our denomination, and though our music was appreciated and respected, we were apart from the others.</p>", "tags": [36, 35, 10, 14]}}, {"pk": 33, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p><img style=\"padding-bottom: 8px; padding-right: 10px;\" src=\"/media/ext/filebrowser/jwandrevkev_small.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Ward and Kevin Smith\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" align=\"left\" />So the pastor of a church seeking to have diverse worship calls the musician in and says, \"do you know any black gospel music?\" The question is sincere, but the ramifications are boundless. &nbsp;To the musician,it means a complex series of experiences playing in black churches or learning the blues, funk, swing, or shuffles, and that she is not bound by the song books and hymnals in her resource library. To know black gospel means to be able to improvise on your instrument, to play outside your cultural space, and to feel the music in such a way that black worshipers will be welcomed and not irritated by some awkward rendition of a gratuitous performance of \"Precious Lord\" played like a rock ballad (i.e. \"Oh Darlin'\" by the Beatles). Or worse yet, played without any feeling at all for the inherent longing found in this gospel classic that has been performed many different ways.</p>\r\n<p>This scenario reminds me of NCF-Glenwood's hosting the national Latino conference for the PCA several years ago. We used several Spanish praise songs with our text projection. At one point, one of our Latino guests came back to the projectionist and asked, \"May I put in the correct phonetic markings?\" Even second language Spanish speakers tend to neglect those details, I was told later.</p>\r\n<p>But black gospel music is a derivative of the blues together with the language, forms, and instrumentation of the American church. Some of its streams go back to slave days with call-and-response a cappella music, and others originated in night clubs of the 1930s when Thomas A. Dorsey played there as Ma Rainey's band leader in the Wild Cats Jazz Band. Just with those two cultural origins,we have already alienated many contemporary church musicians. Although there are many church musicians with a background in clubs, if they are white they have most likely played rock, classic rock,country rock, or mainstream pop music. Although that is a good start for contemporary worship, it still lacks the spirit or vibe of a blues musician or a musician who sits at the organ on a typical Sunday playing non-stop while the minister works the crowd and helps people deal with their emotions.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"padding-bottom: 8px; padding-right: 10px;\" src=\"/media/ext/filebrowser/jwatkeys.jpg\" alt=\"JIm Ward at Keys\" width=\"270\" height=\"190\" align=\"left\" />Beyond the style of black gospel, there is also a repertoire. It is not enough to play in a blues style, but one needs to know the tunes of the historic revivalist Baptist churches, or the Church of God in Christ that did not believe in written music until the 1980s. COGIC music philosophy includes that \"We will maintain the fire and exuberance of the former rain, while embracing the promise of the latter rain.\" &nbsp;COGIC artists include Fred Hammond, Kirk Franklin, Walter Hawkins, Andrae Crouch, and the presidentof its International Music Department, Dr. Judith Christie McAllister.</p>\r\n<p>Other renowned musicians from black gospel history and sources include Mahalia Jackson, James Cleveland, Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers, and Shirley Caesar.</p>\r\n<p>Add to this catalog all the favorite songs from 60 years of church music throughout the struggle of African Americans for civil rights and for political significance seated in the local church, and you have an inkling of what your pastor is asking (though he probably doesn't know it) when he says, \"could you play black gospel?\"</p>", "tags": [38, 37, 39, 11]}}, {"pk": 24, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p>A friend of mine asked for help with leads on where to get good congregational songs for worship in the Gospel style.

These links should take you to the sanchezl scores section of www.noteflight.com<span>&nbsp; </span>I do not think that you have to sign up to hear the scores. However, if you do have to sign up, you can do so for free so that you can hear the samples.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span>The samples are presented in the order they were demonstrated at the NCF Music Conference 2011. Most of these links offer samples, not complete songs. The idea is to give you a sense of the basic rhythms. Once you get to the sample scores I have arranged, you should be able to play them on the computer as a whole piece (with all the instruments) or by section (say, for example, if you want to focus on the percussion part). Play around with the program. You'll figure it out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I also think you can print these samples if that is helpful to you. The percussion part is done on drums since the free version of Noteflight does not include Latin percussion choices such as bombo leguero (for South American music) or congas, bongo, or guiro (for Caribbean music). Drum set players will need to creatively adapt these rhythms to their instruments, but knowledge of actual Latin percussion is recommended. I have added representative bass lines to the scores. Piano players can arrange and voice as they see fit, while keeping the basic rhythms suggested in place. Enjoy!</p>\r\n<p>I hope these are helpful starting points for you as you find ways to introduce or expand your use of music from the Latino world in worship. May the Lord bless your musical journeys to His glory and the benefit of our neighbors&mdash;including the Latino neighbors in our midst.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Blessings in Christ.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Leo</p>\r\n<p>Leopoldo A.

Dorsey</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>So many changes have taken place in worship in just my lifetime. I was born in 1950 and it was in that decade that Billy Graham came to New York for the Madison Square Garden Crusade. How that impacted the local church with its evangelistic style and old time gospel music! More recently there was the Jesus movement of the 1970s, and the era of the mega-church in the new millennium. We see evidence all around us of charismatic worship elements or gigantic campuses of full-service ministry for the family.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"padding-bottom: 8px; padding-right: 10px;\" src=\"/media/ext/filebrowser/jw_teachingsm.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Ward Teaching\" width=\"336\" height=\"415\" align=\"left\" />But another change in the church has been more subtle and more infrastructural. It has been the shift to the suburbs by African American and Latino families, and the return to urban areas by young white families looking to have the benefits of downtown living. Young families are moving into previously monocultural neighborhoods and playing in the park alongside longtime black residents.<sup>[1]</sup> One result is that churches planted in the 1950s and 60s as traditional white congregations in the suburbs are being faced with a change in the neighborhood around the church much the same as churches in urban residential areas. One church in the small city of Tupelo, MS is an all-white congregation positioned across the street from a middle class black housing development. The pastor invited me to come and talk with him after a luncheon we had there. &ldquo;I want to have a parish church, uniquely positioned to meet the needs of our immediate community,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How do I begin to do that in our worship if our neighbors are black?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In a strategy for reaching another cultural group, white Christians should recognize that within a people or ethnic group, there is still diversity. African Americans are not a monolithic group any more than whites or Latinos have uniform preferences. Often whites make the mistake of thinking that all blacks will prefer gospel music or will have had a lot of shouting experience growing up. Black Christians may be part of a black Baptist tradition, African Methodist Episcopal, or one of several Pentecostal groups. Some blacks are Catholic or Episcopal, and some are actually Presbyterians. The challenge of creating an inclusive worship environment is reflected in the bungling efforts of churches that stereotype.</p>\r\n<p>If the Tupelo congregation was in a Latino neighborhood, the divergent cultures would be even more pronounced; many Indian groups from countries like Guatemala do not even speak Spanish as a first language. Mexicans have certain types of music that they prefer with instrumentation and exaggerated emotion. Cubans, Dominicans, Brazilians, Ecuadorians, and even some from Argentina have made up the stream of Latino attendees at our church in Chattanooga. Although there are certain widely known songwriters and worship leaders who are popular with Latino worshipers, it often comes out that they may not like certain artists or styles, just like white Americans. It is important to ask immigrants or ethnic visitors who are Christians and who have come from worshipping communities to share their music and their tastes as we seek to welcome them and make a heart home for them in our congregations.</p>\r\n<p>This is but one motivation for a cross-cultural worship strategy&mdash;to reach a local congregation&rsquo;s neighborhood. There are other reasons for cross-cultural worship. One is to recognize change in American society and the witness of the church in that society. Nowhere is the testimony of Christ&rsquo;s followers found more poignant than in the joining together of different races or different classes and cultures. Racism is a universal sin and is found in every nation and culture.</p>\r\n<p>For twenty-five years I was a travelling Christian concert artist, visiting many communities through the US and Canada. Audiences were intrigued by my description of our church and its unique worship. &ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t have any black people here,&rdquo; was the common response. But in the northern provinces of Canada are the Inuit people, an aboriginal group recognized as recently as 1982 who consider the term &ldquo;Eskimo&rdquo; pejorative. In Spain and other countries in Europe the Roma are considered social outcasts. With their origin believed to be from India, wherever they arrived in Europe, curiosity was soon followed by hostility and xenophobia. Roma were enslaved for five centuries in Romania until abolition in 1864. Elsewhere in Europe, they were subject to expulsion, abduction of their children, and forced labor.<sup>[2]</sup> The common term &ldquo;gypsy&rdquo; is considered pejorative by the Roma. Ironically, the music so associated with Spain, flamenco, is of Roma origin. This cultural contradiction sounds similar to the strong heritage of black music from America throughout the world, while blacks in America have had so much struggle and discrimination. And in Kenya, the South Asians and the black Kenyans are historically separate. During the colonial period in Kenya, Europeans were at the top of social status with South Asians below. &ldquo;Although some Asians were able to compete with Europeans in the professions, by far the greatest numbers were retail traders who had shops in small towns, or were artisans, clerks, or bureaucrats on limited salaries. They couldn't compete seriously with Europeans, but in African eyes, Indians always seemed to occupy all the positions to which ambitious Africans with a little education might aspire.&rdquo;<sup>[3]</sup> Here is an example of a higher social class being an ethnic minority. Racism and ethnic segregation is everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>These examples of racial prejudice show why a church with an intentional commitment to cross-cultural worship is an excellent example of Christianity in action. Recently, the city of Chattanooga asked our choir to sing at the dedication of a Cherokee monument called the Passage. &ldquo;We want a diverse group of singers to represent our city&rsquo;s vision,&rdquo; I was told. On a separate occasion, a large contemporary church invited our racially mixed choir to sing at a women&rsquo;s conference. &ldquo;We would like your choir to process into the room with a typical gospel song. We heard that you all were really ethnically diverse, and that&rsquo;s what we want our conference to tap into.&rdquo; Even churches without a cultural commitment to diversity recognize its power to communicate.</p>\r\n<p>A third reason for cross-cultural worship is one that is frequently alluded to by black preachers who visit our church. The guest minister looks out over the assembly and then says, &ldquo;It is a joy and blessing to be with you all today. As I look out over the church, I think this is the way God wants us to be, together, black and white.&rdquo; Further one reads in the book of Revelation of a great multitude of believers, gathered around the throne, of every people, race, and tongue crying &lsquo;Holy, holy, holy! Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.&rdquo; Although it is impossible for us to know what that assembly will sound like, the Bible clearly describes unique cultures united as one in worship. For a vast majority of Christians, black, white, Asian and Latino, that will only be realized in the last day. It is simply impractical, except on certain auspicious occasions, for us to be together. There are too many complications and differences. We are only human.</p>\r\n<p>So whether one might see the neighborhood changing, or desire to make a statement to the watching world about reconciliation, or maybe want to be a little more like heaven, cross-cultural worship has some very strong, poignant reasons for being a priority for pastors and worship leaders.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>1.</strong></h3>\r\n<p>If the church leadership decides that a diverse, or cross-cultural music style is the direction they wish to take, first it must be championed by the pastor. The under shepherd of the flock is called to set the tone for the local church ministry and to lead the charge for evangelism and mission. The congregation looks to him for courage and energy, just as the people of Israel looked to Moses and Joshua for courageous leadership. It is the pastor who can challenge the congregation to step up and choose to submit to one another as different styles of music or worship language are implemented.</p>\r\n<p>Pastors are often plagued with schisms and controversy in the music of the church and some pastors opt for a hands off approach, letting the musicians work out their differences aesthetically and culturally. Some pastors try to establish a strong worship culture based on &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; models that communicate relevance and technological savvy. So called contemporary churches spend large sums of money on sound systems, video support, performance venue worship space, and cool head set mics to attract a certain kind of worshipper on that brief slice of the week from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm depending on how many services, and how early the leadership can get going. This is not only true in the white church; there are black pastors who clean house musically in order to have a strong contemporary gospel sound with louder sound, electronic keyboards, and praise teams replacing the traditional choir.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>2.</strong></h3>\r\n<p>But, secondly,&nbsp;in addition to the pastor there must be capable musicians to back up a commitment to cross-cultural worship. These musicians must be willing to grow and be stretched. They must be willing to visit other churches, listen to recordings and copy styles, and they must have the musical capacity to decipher the elements in a musical style&mdash;rhythm, harmony, melody, timbre, and even the right tempo. In other words, willingness is not enough for music to replicate a cultural focus. Musicians trained in church music are often not trained in improvisation, playing by ear, and transcribing chords and forms from a recording. The best training for this task is in jazz departments. Jazz is the classical music of the African American and Latino communities, and much of the skill to play gospel or salsa is acquired in jazz. Jazz theory is also conducive to cross-cultural church music, since one learns chord voicings, chord alterations, and the matching scales for improvisation, for the blues, and for the variety of urban pop styles&mdash;swing, funk, ballads, samba, and fusion.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>3.</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Thirdly, there is a vocal style of cross-cultural music. Trained singers may have diverse approaches depending on whether they are singing an operatic aria or a popular song. Some trained singers do both very well, and sometimes it is a simple matter of developing articulation for blues, for straighter tone, or for embellishing melodies properly. Untrained singers are usually confident in one or two styles and can &lsquo;belt&rsquo; out lead vocals very well if they have a strong accompaniment. .<sup>[4]</sup> It&rsquo;s when trained and untrained are put together that grace abounds! One of the blessings of cross-cultural or multi-cultural music is the openness and acceptance of variety that seems to result. But lead vocalists in a praise team or song leaders need to have a more vernacular, improvisational style to capture the congregation&rsquo;s attention and not its sympathy. Lead vocalists for white praise songs are often simple straight-tone Celtic-style vocalists. Lead vocalists for Latin music are more expressive, almost romantic stylistically. Lead vocalists for African American music are loved the world over for their powerful, soulful delivery. By God&rsquo;s grace and sovereign provision, singers in a cross-cultural church are equipped to sing the wide variety of music that is needed for unity in the singing body.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>4.</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Musicians who are asked to lead in cross-cultural ministry must have a special skill set. But fourthly, they must also have a spiritual discernment of the mission of worship as they approach each Sunday and each group of musicians with whom they work. If a musician is hired for musical skill, but does not have spiritual eyes, he or she can become an obstruction rather than a facilitator of cross-cultural worship. A musician acting in the flesh can be prideful of talent, harsh toward amateur participants, and even insubordinate toward the leadership. Cross-cultural worship is also culturally rooted in the church traditions it combines, and if a musician has no roots in a church, he or she will capture the style but not the substance of worship music. If it is necessary to hire musicians, there should always be a spiritually motivated leader, whether it be a singer, an administrator, or pastor who is in charge of the music.</p>\r\n<p>At the center of the commitment to cross- or multi-cultural worship is an understanding of &ldquo;heart music.&rdquo; This is an ethnomusicological term and refers to a musical context learned in childhood that most fully expresses one&rsquo;s emotion. This concept, that has been applied to the study of indigenous music by ministries such as Wycliffe Bible Translators, can be similarly applied to North American worship. And when cultures are coming together, or when a person from a minority culture attaches herself to a worshipping body in the majority culture, certain worship expressions are intentionally left behind or even suppressed. I visited a well-known church in Maryland where music is created and recorded for their worship in the dominant contemporary Christian style. I noticed the presence of 200- 300 African Americans in the Sunday morning service. When I remarked that there was a significant number, the worship leader enthused, &ldquo;Yes, they love our teaching&rdquo; but admitted that they were less than enthusiastic about the style of music. In this kind of setting, one worshipper is nourished culturally while the person next to him is unsatisfied. <sup>[5]</sup> Population shifts have changed the very fundamental heart language of congregations. And when cultural blending occurs, a new heart language emerges for our children&mdash;one that is sensitive to the worship sense of disparate peoples. One such song in our congregation is the African American song, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve Come This Far By Faith&rdquo; which has become an anthem of unity and mission, but originated in the black community of the 1970s.</p>\r\n<p>Because &ldquo;heart music&rdquo; is so integral to a sense of belonging, it is necessary that the dominant culture give place to the minority group stylistically. In my experience, black worshipers will always want the music to be blacker, while white worshipers will notice the slightest unfamiliar tune and think, &ldquo;Wow, we&rsquo;re a diverse congregation.&rdquo; I have been asked several times to come and lead worship for a convention to provide diversity. Some committee decided that they needed to diversify. To a white client, diversity is mostly familiar praise songs with a few Latino or African American songs. Whites assume that they are the majority. This is why minority groups of believers have a problem trusting white authority figures who, the minorities believe, are looking out for their own, and using blacks to enhance their image.</p>\r\n<p>Ethnic diversity is a frightening prospect to some whites and to some blacks as well. There are fears of a loss of something one holds dear and there may be sinful fears that the effects of blending cultures will encourage one&rsquo;s sons and daughters to marry someone of a different race or class. There are misunderstandings and stereotypes and other genuine bases for distrust. One African American man about 40 years old in our church testified that the greatest witness to him was a white man in his 70s who accepted and respected him. After all, it wasn&rsquo;t until 1965 that schools in Chattanooga were desegregated. Further, it is hard to come together in worship when one worshipper thinks of the scripture, &ldquo;let all the earth keep silence&rdquo; as a standard for true worship, while the next one is thinking, &ldquo;make a joyful noise.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>One aspect of cross-cultural worship in which I have no experience is that of an existing church deciding to embrace a new ideology of worship and music. Our church in Chattanooga was founded on the principal of blending together. Many other churches must come to an agreement from a previous position of homogeneity. One part of a congregation in Jackson, Mississippi decided to stay in a black neighborhood while another segment moved and purchased a building in another community in order to remain uniform culturally. Recently the music leadership, white and black, taught the original congregation several gospel choir and congregational songs from a New City Fellowship music conference. The people there are energized and excited, posting choir anthems on Youtube.</p>\r\n<p>As frustrating and challenging as it has been, it has also been rewarding and energizing to our congregation. Having a purpose for choosing certain kinds of music that goes beyond one&rsquo;s own tastes and preferences is an exercise in self-denial in the Pauline sense&mdash;&ldquo;Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.&rdquo; (I Corinthians 10:33.) It is one thing to speak of mercy and justice in a seminar or a book, but quite a different thing to act it out in the worship service.</p>\r\n<p>It is also difficult to believe a cause such as racial reconciliation is important, only to see your children grow up to leave the cause for more homogeneous pastures. As wonderful as it may sound, cross-cultural worship seems not to be for everyone. It seems like some of us are more wired for this than others. Or, sometimes cause-oriented churches raise a generation of principled young adults who have tasted of the fruits of racial harmony and express that concept differently, like enrolling their children in a public school with diverse population. The heart language of worshipping together reaches those who give themselves to it, and passes over those who aren&rsquo;t convinced. That doesn&rsquo;t make it irrelevant nor undeserving. Most things worth doing are hard in some way. But for those who are still determined, one of the important details of cross- and multi-cultural worship is resources. Frequently after a worship service, a visitor to our church will come up to the stage and ask, &ldquo;What was the third song you did today? Could I get a copy of the words?&rdquo; Maybe this happens in many churches, but the worshipper should also be asking, &ldquo;Where does that song come from? Has it been published or recorded? Is it on youtube?&rdquo; Finding music for blended worship is one of the most persistent tasks of cross-cultural musicians and pastors. &ldquo;We have an Intervarsity Christian Fellowship worship leader from college and we need him to sound like&hellip;uh&hellip;Andrae Crouch. What songs would you recommend?&rdquo; asked one church planter from Miami. Some resources are easily found in published hymnals. Three I would recommend are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Songs of Zion. 1981, Abingdon Press, Nashville.</li>\r\n<li>Libro de Liturgia y Cantico. 1998, Augsburg Fortress Pub., Minneapolis.</li>\r\n<li>Global Songs for Worship. Faith Alive Christian Resources, Grand Rapids, MI.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The first is one of the best collections of traditional black gospel and spirituals. The second is a Spanish language hymnal published by the Evangelical Lutheran Church, so if you want to sing mainstream hymns in Spanish&mdash;as well as a variety of Spanish liturgical music, this would be a good resource. The third is a collection of praise songs from world cultures, and is good if your church is experimenting with worldwide music styles. <sup>[6]</sup> I recommend these, not as the single purchase one might make, but as the beginning of a collection of similar songbooks, depending on your direction as a congregation.</p>\r\n<p>Another important resource is real live worship in churches where the target group may be found. In the early days of our mission, we would go to black churches and listen to their choirs, their pianists, their soloists, and their songs. It was there that we heard &ldquo;I&rsquo;m So Glad Trouble Don&rsquo;t Last Always,&rdquo; and &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Leak in This Old Building.&rdquo; These songs gave a familiar ring to our otherwise halting efforts. I am often amused when I hear a black praise team member say, &ldquo;this is the New City way of doing that song. It&rsquo;s not the way I grew up with.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Increasingly online resources are available for minimal cost. If you know a song you want to do, chances are it is on itunes, youtube, or Amazon.com. Sometimes it&rsquo;s knowing which songs to start with, and that comes from listening, visiting, and going to the fountainhead of culture. There is no shortcut. Don&rsquo;t try to create authenticity overnight. Frequently the resources that will be the most valuable and durable are right in your own church. Ask a Latino or African American worshiper what the equivalent of &ldquo;How Great Thou Art&rdquo; is in his or her culture. When I asked that question a few years ago, my friend said, &ldquo;What a Fellowship.&rdquo; That is the same as &ldquo;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&rdquo; found in most white hymnals. But it is the way it is sung and played that gives it authenticity. Ask your own people to bring you CDs or music of songs they love. This will build a strong sense of belonging when your favorite gospel song turns up in the order of worship next Sunday! At this writing, our church music ministry is slowly uploading content to a website for this very purpose. <a href=\"/\">Ncfmusic.com</a> will be sheet music of public domain hymns like &ldquo;Down at the Cross/Glory to His Name&rdquo; written out in 12/8 time the way it is played by gospel pianists. The site will include audio recordings, video, and podcasts, as well as written articles on ethnic worship from several angles. There are other resources like this in a variety of places, so dig deep and find what works for you. GIA Publications, the largest Roman Catholic music publisher even has the African American Heritage Hymnal.</p>\r\n<p>Finding the right songs to use can be a hit or miss proposition. Your musicians may think they are on the right track, but they must listen, listen, listen to the minority population in your church and meet people where they are. Just because a song has a nice back beat or is soulful in the melody doesn&rsquo;t mean Aunt Hattie will like it. You may find yourself with a hip group of musicians thinking they are hitting the target with cool chords and R&amp;B, when all the while there are certain traditional songs to be explored and rendered. Even contemporary gospel artists who have created a &ldquo;new standard&rdquo; for praise music will sometimes include a remake of some old song like &ldquo;The Lord Will Make a Way Somehow&rdquo; by Thomas A. Dorsey. In other words, the cross-cultural palette is a blend of traditional dominant culture, contemporary dominant, traditional co-cultural music, .<sup>[7]</sup> and contemporary co-cultural music.</p>\r\n<p>These few thoughts and anecdotes are important ones but they do not define the only way to do cross-cultural worship music. The city of Chattanooga is a demographic that may skew our strategy a bit. However, we do have visitors from around the world, and it seems we are getting close to what folks expect of a cross-cultural worship setting. It is my experience that church music in general is a stressful task for the full- or part-time music director. One must sense what the pastor wants, put that together with the available volunteer pool, sprinkle in some instruments and resources, and mix it with special events. But adding in the element of cross-cultural strategy increases the pressure on the church musician to produce results that are almost impossible without a generation of trust and development. If the church is working in a neighborhood with mixed economic and educational aspects, it can be complicated to get folks to work together freely. It can mean handing out lyric sheets that you have carefully prepared to match the sheet music. It can mean working on very simple music notationally, but which requires swaying and clapping or improvising sections of the music at the bidding of the director. It may mean learning words in other languages and pronouncing them correctly. It may mean having a person who is adept at motivating or relating, but is&nbsp;unschooled.</p>\r\n<p>For those of us in the dominant culture who are seeking to reach outside our own comfort zone, it will mean stepping back and leading from the sidelines a lot. The focus will be off you and on the other participants, some of whom are not as skilled as you. It will mean laughing at yourself as people in your program are laughing at your clumsiness, but realizing that physical movement is an important part of being cross-cultural, period.</p>\r\n<p>A strategy for cross-cultural worship will bear much fruit in time, as the local body commits to reaching a people group at various levels of mercy, justice, and worship. An initial reaction from a member or new attendee of &ldquo;wow, thanks for that song, it reminded me of my grandma&rsquo;s church&rdquo; gives the rush of excitement when you finally hit a homerun culturally. After a while, you may hit some bumps in the road, whether it&rsquo;s the loss of a great singer to personal problems or the antagonism of ethnocentric members. Progress in cultural issues is measured in decades of various efforts, and if you are reaching out to a different culture, you may not get a ringing endorsement ever from the target group. Sometimes the best indication is that talented folks say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when you ask them to participate.</p>\r\n<p>In 1978, my wife and I returned to New City Fellowship from Pennsylvania, having worked with a jazz band for two and a half years, and found it unproductive. Sometime during that year I wrote a song called &ldquo;Make Me a Vessel&rdquo; about God taking us through the fire and the water to make us fit vessels for his Kingdom.</p>\r\n<p>By that time, one of our members was an old African American woman who had lived the hard life of years in the south. She had even played guitar in speakeasies as a young woman. Her teeth were stained from chewing tobacco. She was thin and stooped over but she had a ready smile and a testimony.</p>\r\n<p>On a Sunday morning at the dilapidated YMCA where we were meeting, I sang the song as a special selection. By that time I was playing and singing in a soulful style. As the song came to a crescendo, there was a scream from the back of the small meeting room. We were all surprised, and then realized that Miss Betty was &ldquo;shouting&rdquo; in response to the performance.&nbsp;This song was not an old traditional gospel song. I was as white as the driven snow. But God gave me a gift that day; the gift of a uniquely ethnic response to my musical offering in the early days of our worship&rsquo;s taking shape. It remains as a milestone in my heart of his calling to cross-cultural music and worship.</p>\r\n<p>So think hard about whether this is God&rsquo;s calling on your vocation or your church. Some musicians never make a conscious choice, they simply find themselves needed and able to fill that need. Your strategy may be a great one, but God&rsquo;s calling is in his sovereign wisdom without all the answers spelled out. He will make a way, when there is no way. He did for me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\r\n<p><sup>[1]</sup> Black folks have come a long way from cultural uniformity of even a generation ago.

Randy and I were visiting a church in a southern city. This church has a black pastor who had brought in a black woman to be the music director in a church, that had less than 2 years previously, <span>&nbsp;</span>been all white. Randy was doing a seminar on mercy, and during one of the breaks he brought a woman over to meet me and than he said &ldquo;Joan, talk to her&rdquo;. <span>&nbsp;</span>This woman loved the fact that the church was becoming increasingly cross-cultural and multi-racial. She adored her pastor and she was really behind the mission and vision of the church to reach the surrounding black community, that this African-American pastor was leading the congregation in. She started weeping, as she said, &ldquo;I understand what we&rsquo;re doing. I love it, I think it&rsquo;s wonderful but I really can&rsquo;t stand this music that this new music director is bringing in.&rdquo; I was kind of blown away by her, mostly because she was so honest. Usually when people have problems like that, they don&rsquo;t start there; they start with something &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;. <span>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I believe God wants us to worship &lsquo;this way&rsquo; because&hellip;&rdquo; but she said, &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like it. What do I do?&rdquo; I really appreciated her honesty.<span>&nbsp; </span>I rarely hear people in her situation being that transparent and honest. Basically, she had made a judgment regarding black music and culture. She was unfamiliar with it; she was uncomfortable with it; she was afraid of it and she felt bad and sad about her fears. The fact is that African-American music and culture is different from white music and culture and for the first time in her life she had to deal with that difference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br /><img style=\"padding-bottom: 8px; padding-right: 10px;\" title=\"Joan Nabors\" src=\"/media/ext/filebrowser/joan_seminar.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Nabors\" width=\"336\" height=\"437\" align=\"left\" />The worship cultures of African-Americans and white-Americans in this country come out of very different experiences. <span>&nbsp;</span>Blacks in this country came to understand the one true God from a very different place than where whites did. White culture was birthed in Northern Europe. Between 550A.D. to 1543 which was the year of the reformation in Germany, congregations didn&rsquo;t sing at all. If you&rsquo;ve ever been to Europe and seen the beautiful Cathedrals, they&rsquo;re full of art. The church service was conducted in Latin and not many of the people who came to those services spoke Latin except for the priest. The people that were there spoke another language in their daily lives- German or English. The choir sang, in Latin, and the preaching was in Latin. There was very little that happened in the service that people could actually understand. It was hoped that they would learn something from the art on the walls; the rest was beautiful and mysterious, like they were told God was.</p>\r\n<p>This is why Martin Luther and the other reformers were often hymn writers. <span>&nbsp;</span>They began to write hymns in the languages that the people actually spoke. The songs that they wrote were full of theology so the people, as they sang could express the truths that were found in the bible. There is also a great Psalm singing tradition of actually just using the Psalms as they were written and putting those to music.</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span>African Americans came to this country from Africa, and a culture that was very communal and participatory. For African-Americans worship has never been a &ldquo;spectator sport.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t just sit there and absorb. <span>&nbsp;</span>When we listen to a singer or a choir sing we are admiring the skill and the art that&rsquo;s involved and we also admire the personal experience that is expressed in the music or preaching. I think that we all yearn to know that God is helping us and guiding us in our daily lives. Hearing about somebody else&rsquo;s experience of God&rsquo;s presence in their lives that&rsquo;s expressed in music and feeling the emotion behind it when somebody else is singing or when we&rsquo;re singing- causes our hearts to be stirred and our faith to grow. It always calls for a response. For an African-American, worship is more of a communal experience.</p>\r\n<p>One of the best experiences of my life happened this past summer <span>&nbsp;</span>when my son got married. My third and youngest son got married in Kenya, he married a Kenyan woman. My husband, my daughter and I traveled there for the wedding. One amazing thing, I took lots of pictures and when you look at them it looks very much like an American wedding. But being there, the experience was extremely different. The actual service was very similar but we all made promises to God regarding this marriage. There was a 30 voice choir. They sang, and we all sang together. <span>&nbsp;</span>The wedding guests had come for the whole day. All they wanted to do on that day was celebrate this couple and their new lives together.<span>&nbsp; </span>The time we spent was as much about us being together as it was about the bride and groom. African Americans come out of more of a community focused culture and it shows in the way we worship. And we also come out of a culture that was forged in suffering.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will praise you forever.&rdquo;<br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Psalm 30:11-12</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>For all of us- whether you&rsquo;re in a black church or a white church- in either or any culture, the congregation; we, whoever we are,&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>are not the audience. God is the audience.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He is the only One who has to be pleased by how we worship Him.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Characteristic cultural Expressions in African-American worship</strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Let&rsquo;s compare and contrast African-American worship with the majority culture&rsquo;s worship.</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Emotion</em></strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>&ldquo;By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.<span>&nbsp; </span>There on the poplars we hung our harps, for there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy; they said, &ldquo;Sing us one of the songs of Zion!&rdquo; How can we sing the songs of the LORD while in a foreign land?&rdquo;<br />Psalm 137:1-4</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>One of the reasons African-Americans, during slavery, were drawn to Christianity was because they were able to make a direct connection in their hearts and minds to the people of Israel and the time they spent <span>&nbsp;</span>in captivity in Egypt, and later Babylon, with the whole experience of slavery. The connection was strong and powerful.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy. I pour out before him my complaint; before him I tell my trouble.&rdquo;<br />Psalm 142:1-2</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In sorrow, in weeping and wailing, and in joy, for African-Americans church was always a place to express our emotional connection to God.<span>&nbsp; </span>From Slavery to share cropping to ghettos, black people found church was the one place they could really cut loose and be themselves. &ldquo;Singers and hearers are participants in the exuberant experience of gospel music. They are caught up in the exciting message of hope and the passionate tone of the music. They sing songs from hearts seeking freedom and relief from God, who they saw as their only hope. They would come away from service feeling like they could face life. They had literally sung themselves to life. They would practice the tradition of &lsquo;praying through&rsquo; praying until they felt they had touched the heart of God and been touched in return.&rdquo; &ndash;Warren</p>\r\n<p>All of this takes passion and energy.</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Volume</em></strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth. <span>&nbsp;</span>Worship the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs. <span>&nbsp;<br /></span>PS 100: 1-2<br /><br />Sing for joy to God our strength; shout aloud to the God of Jacob! <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</span>PS 81:1<br /><br />Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span>PS 57:8</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>These are all scriptures that talk about shouting and just noise. For African-Americans, we aren&rsquo;t bothered by loud if it sounds good. In our congregation we&rsquo;ve had white people complain about the volume. They come up to us after church covering their ears and we say &ldquo;Just take your hands down. We&rsquo;re not turning it down, sorry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Movement</em></strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>&ldquo;David wearing a linen ephod, danced before the Lord with all his might while he and the entire house of Israel brought up the arc of the Lord with shouts and sound of trumpets&rdquo;<br />II Samuel 6:14-15<br /><br />&ldquo;David said to Michael it was before the Lord who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the Lord&rsquo;s people Israel. I will celebrate before the Lord. I will become even more undignified than this and I will humiliated in my own eyes. But by these &hellip;.you spoke of I will be held in honor&rdquo; <br /><span> </span>II Samuel 21-22</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>These are just a couple of excerpts from that story in second Samuel where David was dancing before the ark of God, and he was so filled with joy, <span>&nbsp;</span>that he literally made a fool of himself. A few years ago I saw Richard Gere<span>&nbsp; </span>in the movie &ldquo;David&rdquo; and the movie had that scene of him dancing.<span>&nbsp; </span>He really does look out of control, but just delighted with God. His wife didn&rsquo;t think he was being dignified enough to be the king of Israel and she rebuked him and this was his response,</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I will be even more undignified before the Lord&hellip;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.&rdquo; <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span>PS 28:2</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to sit still in worship. I watch the congregation when I&rsquo;m on praise team or in the choir, and I see people just standing there, and I often wonder: how do you do that? For most African Americans moving back and forth (swaying), nodding heads, clapping hands, raising hands, and even dancing is the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; response to a great song or an inspiring sermon. Scripture says its okay move around when you worship. I&rsquo;m not saying that you have to move around, but maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t dump on people who do.</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Spontaneity</em></strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>I don&rsquo;t have a scripture for this, but what I mean by spontaneity is this, in the black church the congregation participates in such a way that neither the leaders or the people <span>&nbsp;</span>know what&rsquo;s going to happen next. This creates flexibility in a worship service and it also accounts in part for why African-American services don&rsquo;t always begin or end on time.</p>\r\n<p>Last fall I had the opportunity to visit my grandmother in New Haven.<span>&nbsp; </span>We got there on a Friday night and my grandmother informed me that if I wanted to see her she would be in church.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we went to church.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was the same C.O.G.I.C church she used to take me to when I was a little girl. They were having<span>&nbsp; </span>a youth service that night and it was scheduled to start at nine. We got there at nine-twenty and there were five people in the sanctuary. It was almost 10 o clock when the pastor got up and started the worship time.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was no point in him starting earlier because there was no one there. He started his singing and people kept coming. <span>&nbsp;</span>The praise team started singing and people kept coming. Then they started having different gospel groups sing, and this apparently attracted young people, because there were lots of them there. We left around eleven because we&rsquo;d driven all day to get there, and we were tired. People were still coming, as we were leaving. Groups were still coming, <span>&nbsp;</span>buses were still coming! I called my aunt the next day to ask what time they left and she said &ldquo;a quarter till three in the morning.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>My eighty-nine year old grandmother, stayed, and she never goes home early.</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Adlibbing or &ldquo;lining&rdquo;</em></strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>&ldquo; I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the LORD and put their trust in him. I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help. I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness from the great assembly.&rdquo;<br /><span>&nbsp;</span>Psalm 40: 1-3, 10</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In the gospel tradition the leader would often &ldquo;line out&rdquo; a song and sing several bars ahead of the congregation so that the congregation would know what to sing next. This is a valuable technique and it&rsquo;s actually necessary if the song has never been written down, or if you don&rsquo;t have any books or if you can&rsquo;t read. In these situations it helps to have a leader sing what you&rsquo;re supposed to sing next. Often the lining is sung and the leader will improvise on the line as he sings it ahead of the congregation. In this way is even a very familiar song like, for example &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come this far by faith&rdquo; is a little different every time it&rsquo;s sung. This is an important characteristic of African-American music.</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Improvisation</em></strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>Improvisation, is similar to &ldquo;lining&rdquo; and involves repetition.<span>&nbsp; </span>In black music lines are often repeated many times especially at the end of a song. This gives additional opportunity for improvisation. The singer is then able to explore different techniques and performance styles. Gospel music is a singer&rsquo;s art more so than a composer&rsquo;s. The singers and congregation get to remember just what it means that &ldquo;Jesus is a Fence&rdquo; as Fred Hammond tells us in one of my favorite songs. <span>&nbsp;</span>He sings that God is a protection not only for me,<span>&nbsp; </span>but also my family, at any time, day or night. <span>&nbsp;</span>As he sings we also get to remember when God was there between us and danger that constantly threatens to destroy our peace. . White people tend to have a problem with this because there is not enough &ldquo;content&rdquo; and to have somebody repeat something that many times is annoying. Lots of classical music such as the &ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus&rdquo; just repeats the same words over and over. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some how you get something out of it.</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Common themes</em></strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong><em></em></strong>For you, LORD, have delivered me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before the LORD in the land of the living. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span>Psalm 116: 8-9<br /><br />He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death&rsquo; or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.&rdquo; <span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>Revelation 21:4</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In the African-American gospel tradition themes have to do with God helping or delivering the individual or comforting his people in their trials. The tradition began with spirituals whose lyrics were often based on bible stories and concepts of moral behavior. They especially highlight stories about Moses who represented freedom from bondage and Jesus who also suffered injustice. We also like to sings songs about heaven where things are going to be very different than they are here and the place where we&rsquo;re <span>&nbsp;</span>going to be reunited with loved ones. This knowledge that we would see our loved ones again was especially important to a people who lived with the knowledge that your whole family could be sold away from you, and your brightest hope was that someday you&rsquo;d see them in heaven. <span>&nbsp;</span>There is also a difference in black gospel and white music in who is addressed. Unlike other genres traditional gospel music does not usually address God directly. The songs usually rehearse what God is doing in the life of the believer or what the believer hopes God will do. &ldquo;Lord Help Me to Hold Out&rdquo; Some of the younger artists like Kirk Franklin or Richard Smallwood, however, often address God directly in the songs they write.</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Preaching</em></strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong><em></em></strong>In that day you will say: &ldquo;Give praise to the LORD, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done, and proclaim that his name is exalted.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sing to the LORD, for he has done glorious things; let this be madeknown to all the world. Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.&rdquo; <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </span>Isaiah 12:4-6</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In the African-American tradition sermons and prayers are often sung, in the south this is called &ldquo;hooping&rdquo;. The preacher tells a story in simple direct words and each line is given a response by the people such as: &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; &ldquo;Halleluiah!&rdquo; &ldquo; Help &lsquo;em Lord!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; It often sounds a lot like a conversation between the preacher and the congregation.<span>&nbsp; </span>One book I read said that some scholars think that this was the origin of the spirituals, this &ldquo;call and response&rdquo; sort of sermonizing that was eventually written down and then sung. According to Ms. Warren, &ldquo;this tradition goes back to slavery when slave preachers would moan, hum and sing in order to stir up the gift within and seek revelation and illumination from God.&rdquo; This can be a very emotional experience. If the content is biblical, it&rsquo;s great preaching, because it&rsquo;s <span>&nbsp;</span>really reaching the hearts of the people.</p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>The Shout</em></strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong><em></em></strong>This is not something we do at New City,<span>&nbsp; </span>The Shout is a very physical and vocal expression of praise. It involves dancing and shouting and screaming and calling on God. It is the believer&rsquo;s way of very fervently praising and glorifying God in a very physical and vocal way. For many people it is a turn-off but I think for many this <em>is</em> the way that they worship, and<span>&nbsp; </span>it can be<span>&nbsp; </span>a heart felt <span>&nbsp;</span>expression of worshipping God.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>The Problem of Interpretation.</em></strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong><em></em></strong>As we think about the differences between African-American and white culture in worship often what we&rsquo;re dealing with is a difference in interpretation. For someone from another culture looking in our exuberance and passion is viewed as people being out of control or just being loud and noisy; improvisation and adlibbing, is called performance or showing off; spontaneity, is called uncertainty or confusion.<span>&nbsp; </span>And these things are judged harshly by our critics. What David says in II Samuel 6 is relevant here; what may seem humiliating and undignified, if it is done with a heart that is seeking to please God and celebrate before Him, gives God glory.&nbsp;</p>", "tags": [38, 37, 43, 35, 21, 34, 9, 11, 33]}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">It happens to every worship leader or pastor probably every Sunday.

Fortunately, we have the countless examples in scripture of how God&rsquo;s children fail to reject these lies and yet He is gracious and patient. Think of Abraham&rsquo;s lie about Sarah to Pharaoh, Israel&rsquo;s response to the spies report of Canaan, or the disciples scattering from Jesus after he was arrested. Fear and shame are the scorched earth of a demonic campaign to usurp the good, gracious promises of our loving Father.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">As a worship leader, when these lies coming rushing into your head, you can only fall on the power of God to fight the battle. If we look at our own resources to fight the battle we can lose our courage and like the army of Israel in the face of the warrior Goliath, we tremble in fear. If we fix our eyes on the power of our Redeemer, who is mighty to save, who has been faithful in the past to be our refuge and strength, then we will be like the young David who faced the power of the enemy without the King&rsquo;s armor because he had the protection of the one true God. David was able to remember how God had delivered him from the bear and the lion and that was the power of his faith. Every Sunday, we practice the Lord&rsquo;s Supper so that we can also look back and remember God&rsquo;s faithfulness and find the power, not in our hands, but in the Rock of our Salvation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">Spiritual warfare is real. It&rsquo;s not the stuff of teenage vampires or back-masking subliminal mind control. The weapons of the enemy are more subtle and more crafty. Observe how your heart responds in worship. If there is fear or shame, then you are being attacked and you need to &ldquo;preach the gospel to yourself&rdquo; in order to remember God&rsquo;s unshakable promises. If you are feeling conviction or reverence, these might look like fear and shame, but they will ultimately lead you to the cross and in the end, to comfort and joy.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "tags": [43, 16, 25, 14, 33]}}, {"pk": 9, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">Multicultural worship is always striving to find the balance between worship that is accessible to whole group and worship that is authentic to the particular cultural styles represented. Practically, it looks like, &ldquo;Should we make this song easy for everybody to sing and understand, or do we present it as an accurate reproduction of the intended cultural style despite the fact that it will leave 90% of the congregation confused and alienated?&rdquo; Most churches (especially from my tradition, reformed) would say &ldquo;accessibility is king!&rdquo; But, in a multicultural church we have to recognize that one man&rsquo;s meat is another man&rsquo;s poison. What&rsquo;s simple and understandable to me is confusing to someone else. Also, authenticity is very important to showing honor to the culture from which a song is born. We&rsquo;ve all experienced the awkward and sometimes offensive attempts of someone who doesn&rsquo;t know us or understand us try to relate by playing your music, but badly. At best it&rsquo;s totally lame. At worst, it comes off as&nbsp; a derogatory stereotype (for example the history of&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #20a3ca; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_shows\">Minstrel Shows</a>&nbsp;in the United States.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">So what do we work toward? Authentic or accessible?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">What&rsquo;s great about our God is that he has given us a means to make our worship accessible and authentic to him. Worship is accessible to God through the ministry of the Great High Priest, Jesus Christ. He is the Way. He is the temple, the sacrifice, the priest, and the Risen King who intercedes for us. Our worship is always accessible to&nbsp; God. God&rsquo;s worship must always be authentic. Authenticity to the Lord is worship that defends the cause of the widow and orphan, that does justly and loves mercy and walks humbly. Worship that is inauthentic claims to love God while ignoring the cries of God&rsquo;s children. Through the resurrection power of Jesus, we can also pursue justice and mercy which reflects authentic worship before the Lord. It&rsquo;s all an act of grace from first to last. God saved us in order to do good works that were prepared in advance for us to accomplish. The Good Shepherd leads his sheep into paths of righteousness.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">So, in multicultural worship, as we wrestle with the issues of accessibility and authenticity, we can be assured that we have a high priest who can sympathize with the struggle. He had to make himself a man for us. He had to be the perfect blend of accessible and authentic for us so that we could be able to worship in fellowship with the Father just as he is one with the Father.</span></p>", "tags": [37, 34, 9, 11, 33]}}, {"pk": 10, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">I&rsquo;m preparing for this summer by looking for some good reading material for a group of interns that I will be leading in some discussion on worship leading. I was a little disappointed that in all my excellent books on worship and music, I couldn&rsquo;t find any clear presentation of the role of the gospel of Jesus, our Great High Priest, in giving us access to the Throne of worship. It&rsquo;s easy to list all the things that a &ldquo;worship leader&rdquo; needs to have: a heart for Jesus,  Spirit-led voice, a pastor&rsquo;s heart, the passion of a warrior,  wisdom and theological training, the hands of a cheetah, guitar tone like a hot-buttered chainsaw, the list goes on and on. Those are all good things to pursue, but the foundation on which all our worship is the cross of Jesus Christ.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -1px;\">Nothing in my hands I bring</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">As fallen and idolatrous people, we can bring nothing to God that would make our worship acceptable in His sight. One of the most frightening stories in the Bible is when Aaron&rsquo;s sons bring &ldquo;unauthorized&rdquo; incense before the presence of God. Fire roasts them alive like Nazis in &ldquo;Raiders of the Lost Ark&rdquo;. The one true God is holy, holy, holy, so don&rsquo;t be bringin&rsquo; no unauthorized incense up in here. Don&rsquo;t fool yourself to think that you have any worship to bring to the Lord that will be acceptable. In order to come to worship on our own merits, we have to mentally reduce God into a idol that we can manipulate and then pretend and perform as if we are flawless saints. But, the truth is that God has never had any need for our sacrifices; the blood of bulls and goats can&rsquo;t save anybody. The whole point of the tabernacle and the temple worship was demonstrating faith in the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace to redeem and forgive a people who don&rsquo;t deserve it. Our hands are empty when we approach God in worship.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -1px;\">Now, I approach the throne, and I have confidence</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">We can only come to worship by the blood of the Great High Priest whose blood speaks and defends us. His blood covers us, atones for our sin, justifies the wicked, and gives us confidence to come to the throne. The Blood is a sign that we have been adopted into the family as sons and daughters. Now that we are in the family, we can come in to the banquet of grace and participate in the celebration and adoration of the Father. This is good news for sinners. How many times does the enemy accuse us with our list of failures? How many times do we start to believe the lies that our effort, our emotion, our thoughts, or our heart attitude have to get right before we can sing a song of praise to Jesus. Bring your sin right out into the front of your heart in worship. Give the Lord your sins and cry out, &ldquo;I am a man of unclean lips, and I come from a people of unclean lips!&rdquo; When we cry out to the Father from the mire of our sin, the blood and the resurrection are the firm Rock on which we stand and the source of the new song that is placed in our mouths.

I could tell you the gospel message and share all the significant stories from the bible, but I still felt confused about the whole point. I believed that Jesus died to save me from my sins so that I could go to heaven when I died. But it all seemed so selfish. I was practicing a religion that was just a self-help therapy with the added &ldquo;fire-insurance&rdquo; for my safety. I didn&rsquo;t have a grip on what it all meant.

It&rsquo;s to glorify and enjoy the Creator. To relate to Him in a way that combines worship or &ldquo;fear&rdquo; with joy. We are designed for praise the way that a bird&rsquo;s wing is designed for flight. We are designed for discipleship the way an eye is designed to see. Praise is the thing that we are designed to do forever. This realization opened up my mind and my heart to believe that the gospel, the church, and the path of following Jesus was not ultimately about self-preservation, but it was about being restored to the function that we were designed to complete.

In fact, the only reason you would want that is if there was something specifically negative about color. Actually, who we are is a beautiful collection of believers who reflect different aspects of God&rsquo;s image. If God is the light, then we, his image bearers, might be considered a rainbow, each reflecting a different aspect of his character.

I actually had 4 separate people mention to me that they noticed this fact. If there were 4 that said something to my face, how many noticed, but were not likely to confront me about it?

It would be like asking, &ldquo;Why do we have a steeple or wear ties?&rdquo; Of course we have a choir, it&rsquo;s what you do in church. Other churches never ask this question because they have tossed out the choir concept along with a whole host of other&nbsp; Christian cultural institutions in order to be relevant. As far as these folks are concerned, the choir can go the way of the pew, stained glass, and&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #20a3ca; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://www.preciousmoments.com/\">Precious Moments</a>&nbsp;figurines.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">So, why do we, New City Fellowship, have a choir? I have three thoughts:</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 30px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06em; padding: 0px;\">The restoration of worldview</h3>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">We were created as &ldquo;good&rdquo; image bearers of God. He made us to exist in harmony with the rest of creation, with each other, and with God. The fall ruined all that, and now we have a fractured and distorted view of reality. A choir&rsquo;s job is to stand up and declare the Truth to broken hearts. A good choir anthem (like any good worship song) is designed to realign our perception of reality back in line with God&rsquo;s word. It&rsquo;s like balancing the checkbook of your heart. Hmm, that sounds like a good country song.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 30px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06em; padding: 0px;\">The priesthood of all believers</h3>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">The reason that we can perform (gasp!) choir anthems in worship is because God has used Jesus Christ to ordain the new covenant in which he has placed his Spirit in every adopted child of faith so that we can all become priests (and priestesses) in the kingdom. This means that every Christian has the role of mediating between God and the world in order to demonstrate his powerful and holy love. Hallelujah! A choir is a simple cross section of believers (sinners saved by grace) who have been given the priestly role of ministry. Check out the book of Chronicles and you&rsquo;ll find descriptions of massive choirs and orchestras of Levites, the priests. The new covenant that Christ has mediated means that we are all given Levitical roles in the kingdom.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 30px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06em; padding: 0px;\">The incarnation of theology</h3>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">Theology is a big deal. Everyone has a theology, whether they admit it or not. Jesus Christ was the incarnation of the Word. The Word made flesh. In worship, we have the job of taking words and giving them flesh. The choir takes theological concepts and sings about them. This gives the congregation a tangible experience of that word. Reading &ldquo;death is ended&rdquo; is pretty cool, but have you been to a funeral at New City Fellowship where a massive group of believers stands up and sings at the top of their voice &ldquo;DEATH IS ENDED!&rdquo;? That is a serious experience of incarnate theology.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">So.. come sing with us in the choir.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "tags": [13, 37, 33]}}, {"pk": 14, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">I&rsquo;ve had a few comments lately that our worship services have been particularly good lately. I&rsquo;m not sharing this to &ldquo;blow my own horn&rdquo; because if you&rsquo;ve been reading this blog for very long, you know that it&rsquo;s not about me. People will say to me, &ldquo;Worship was sooooo good this Sunday!&rdquo; I always say thank you, and then I usually say, &ldquo;I know;&nbsp; it was awesome, wasn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s my way of subtly reminding them that the worship service is something I am participating and experiencing in much the same way that they are. I know what we&rsquo;re singing before hand and I am of course leading the song, but I am still just another member of the &ldquo;congregation&rdquo; of people who are sharing the experience of God&rsquo;s presence and remembering His grace together.</span><span style=\"color: #555555; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;\"> </span></p>\r\n<div class=\"entry\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">\r\n<div class=\"postbody entry clearfix\" style=\"min-width: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">Lately, I&rsquo;ve been having this conversation more often. Why has it been so good these days? Is there a new group of skilled leaders and musicians? Not really, it&rsquo;s just the same ol&rsquo; folks with a few fresh faces. Have I been praying and communing with the Spirit more? I wish that I could say that I have.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">I think that a lot of it stems from a deeper sense of humility that our congregation has been experiencing. Some humility is coming as fall out from some ministry failures that we experience a few years ago. Humility has also come as a result of some broken relationships. Our hearts have been broken as we see a faithful servant and friend in our church battling stage 4 cancer. All of us, especially those who are in the music team, feel this growing sense of the fear of God&rsquo;s sovereignty mixed with a deeper longing for the resurrection and the liberation from the curse of sin. This is exactly what produces good worship: broken hearts, desperate dependence on the cross, a longing to hold on to the unchanging hand of our beautiful savior.<br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" />The band might be a little more rockin&rsquo; and the singers a little more unrestricted in their praise. But, it&rsquo;s not because we&rsquo;ve been practicing any more than normal. We are just feeling a little more dependent on Jesus to be our Lord.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">A song we sang this morning says it all:</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 65px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px; background-image: url(http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/fusion/images/blockquote.png); background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; color: #939494; line-height: 23px; background-position: 0% 0%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; color: #777777; font-size: 13px; padding: 8px;\"><em style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Mambo sawa sawa Yesu akiwa ezini, mambo sawa sawa</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">Translation: Things are already better with Jesus on the throne, things are already better.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "tags": [43, 21, 34, 16, 14, 33]}}, {"pk": 16, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">There&rsquo;s a few tools that I&rsquo;ve learned to employ to train myself in different cultural styles of worship that I can share with the blog readers. Of course, when you work for a church like mine, there&rsquo;s not much of a music budget, so I&rsquo;ve had to learn to be resourceful with the awesome power of the web. Here&rsquo;s a few places to get started:</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">1. iTunes, iTunes, iTunes.</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">I am surprised that more people have not discovered how awesome iTunes is when you really dig into it. A lot of folks in my church are under the impression that this software is only for iPod owners. In reality, iTunes is just a place to buy music that you can save onto your computer for listening, burn to a CD or upload to your mp3 player of choice. iTunes has a great store that can also be an education in music. Start by taking one artist that you know, let&rsquo;s say Kirk Franklin that everyone on the planet is familiar with. Type that into the search and go to his link where you&rsquo;ll see all his recordings and on the right you&rsquo;ll see a list of artist who are similar. So, you can follow those links to other artists and songs all day long, getting deeper and deeper into the gospel experience. Each song plays a 30 second sample which is enough to get the general vibe. If you hear something you like, create a playlist and drag and drop the song into the list. At the end of your session you might choose to buy a few tracks, but you can still learn a lot for free from those little samples.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">2. YouTube</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">You can also go over to YouTube and type in the names of a few artists and you will find scores of videos that are sometimes just the track from the CD in it&rsquo;s entirety. This is certainly not legal to post, but it&rsquo;s there for you to experience if you don&rsquo;t feel guilty about it. You are not stealing by listening to it. Again, if you really like the track, then buy it. YouTube also provides suggestions, and so you can spend all day listening to videos. Check out my previous post to see what the type of videos I&rsquo;m describing. This is also a great tool for finding African music. Type &ldquo;African Gospel&rdquo; or a word like &ldquo;Nzambe&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yesu&rdquo; into the search and you will get a bunch of videos of African gospel.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">3. Internet Radio</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">Now head back over to iTunes. If you look at the top left hand side under &ldquo;Library&rdquo; you will see an icon labeled &ldquo;Radio&rdquo;. This takes you to a massive catalog of radio internet radio stations organized by genre. This has been fun to discover because the actual radio in my car is pretty lame. Internet Radio takes me back to the days when you would sit by the radio with your finger on record to catch a good song on tape. My sister had boxes of radio mix tapes. What a fun time of musical discovery! Internet Radio is not on demand, but it&rsquo;s another way to open your mind up to what people are listening to who are from another culture. Listening to the good stuff along with the bad means that you are becoming more discerning. You can be conversant in the style so that you can engage with that style in a constructive way. What makes good rap and bad rap? What makes good Soukous and bad Soukous? How does Kirk Franklin&rsquo;s sound compare to Donnie McClurkin?</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">4. All Music Guide (allmusic.com)</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">This is a little more intensive. The All Music Guide website has bios on artists, articles on the development of genres, and even album and song reviews. This website is for when you are read to really learn more about the origins of the sounds you hear. It helps you understand the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of certain sounds. Pick a genre or even a country and start reading about what music is part of their cultural landscape. This website has been a big source of information for me about the Congolese sound. (I could also recommend Wikipedia for this sort of thing.)</span></p>", "tags": [37, 11, 40, 33]}}, {"pk": 15, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">My friend, Parker, wrote a song that we sang in our worship service this past weekend. It was fun to help him take an idea in his head and flesh it out. The artist reflects the image of the Creator as well as the image of the Incarnate Redeemer through the Spirit&rsquo;s influence. We were able to take Parker&rsquo;s song and turn the word into flesh with a Samba beat.</span><span style=\"color: #555555; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"entry\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">\r\n<div class=\"postbody entry clearfix\" style=\"min-width: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">So how do you write a worship song?<br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" /><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" />Tip #1: Keep a steady diet of Spirit food through mediation on scripture.</strong><br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" />If a songwriter&rsquo;s heart is marinated in the word of God, you will overflow with new songs. It also keeps you rooted in Truth so that you don&rsquo;t end up writing things that sound poetic, but are not really true. You might not write any songs derived from scripture texts, but the word of God is his intentional revelation of himself. If you want your song to worship Jesus, you need to be deeply tuned into who he is and why he&rsquo;s worthy of worship.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "tags": [27, 45, 33]}}, {"pk": 17, "model": "content.article", "fields": {"article_body": "<p><span style=\"color: #555555; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;\"> </span></p>\r\n<div class=\"entry\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">\r\n<div class=\"postbody entry clearfix\" style=\"min-width: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\"><a style=\"color: #20a3ca; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://worshipinthecity.stlouisblogs.org/archives/images/5.30.06%20008.jpg\"><img style=\"margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 10px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; border-top-left-radius: 4px 4px; border-top-right-radius: 4px 4px; border-bottom-right-radius: 4px 4px; border-bottom-left-radius: 4px 4px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 3px; border: 1px solid #e7e8e6;\" src=\"http://worshipinthecity.stlouisblogs.org/archives/images/5.30.06%20008-thumb.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"5.30.06 008.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /></a><br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">Thank you for your prayers for the&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #20a3ca; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://ncfbridge.org/?p=105#more-105\">Congo Prayer Conference.</a>&nbsp;It was a truly unique experience for me.

According to my African friends, God has blessed me with the unusual ability to sing in various African languages with no apparent accent. I have also spent time learning how to play the guitar in a Congolese style and was able to hold my own playing with the other African musicians. So, all the conference attendees were quite amused with this white boy (\"mzungu\" as they say in Swahili) who would sing and play like he was born and raised in the Congo. At one point, Sarah told me there was an audible chatter and snickering from the audience after I sang a particularly fast phrase in&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #20a3ca; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikongo\">Kikongo</a>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">What is the secret to my success? Leon Mukendi says that I posses the gift of tongues. I don't know about that, but I do know that the Holy Spirit has captured my heart to serve the Lord in a particular time and place and in particular ways. As the music director of a multi-lingual church, I have a calling to pursue the proper pronunciation and stylistic interpretation of the music from our unique cultures. That means that to show love to the Congolese, Kenyan, Liberian, Nigerian, Zambian, Togolese or whomever I need to actively pursue understanding their music better. It's like marriage; I have a calling to pursue my wife by getting to know everything about her.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">So, it was not an accident that I can play and sing certain types of African music. During the past two years since I took this job, I have spent time listening to and analyzing recordings. I have observed how the music is performed by the Africans in our church. I have asked questions and asked for constructive criticism from them. I spent time searching on Google, Amazon, or&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #20a3ca; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/\">AMG</a>&nbsp;terms like&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #20a3ca; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:2139\">\"Congolese music\"</a>&nbsp;or \"African guitar,\" and found recordings or text on the subject.

Jesus was 100% God and yet he became a baby in the context of the Jewish culture at that time. Jesus grew up in that culture learning everything about being a legitimate Jewish man. In this way, Jesus was 100% God and 100% man.&nbsp;<strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">He was the 200% person</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">For us as the followers of Christ, we are called, as Paul said in Philippians 2, to have the same attitude of Christ. We humbly enter into the world and culture around us and become 'babies' in order to become one in spirit and purpose. This is one of the core values of New City Fellowship. Racial reconciliation is a process of humbly submitting ourselves to each other in love and unity through having open and teachable hearts. The authors of this book believed that Jesus becoming the 200% person was something impossible for anyone but God. They postulate that we can't give up more that 75% of our original culture, but we strive to adopt 75% of the new culture. We are called to be a kind 150% person. Let me take a plunge of the deep end and try to appy this principle to some of the practical realities of NCF in St. Louis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">In our church we have some foreign immigrants and refugees. Most of these people are from an African or Latino culture, many speak English only as a second language, and some do not speak or read English at all. I would suggest that these people have by necessity had to sacrifice almost all of their original culture. Although they can often find enclaves of people from their culture in St. Louis, they are forced to become 150% people in order to receive employment, buy groceries, and go to church.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">In our church we also have American minority groups. These people are Black, Asian, or Latino people who have grown up in the US, grew up speaking English, and have for most of the history of the US been marginalized and expected to melt into the melting pot (i.e. become white). These people have the freedom to remain 100% in their original cultures, but many have to find employment outside of their cultural network. In addition, the ones who choose to become a part of NCF are leaving their culturally specific church and giving up even more of their original culture. These people are willingly becoming 150% people by choosing to leave the comfort of their original culture and by the fact that they are minorities in a Anglo dominated context.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\"><em style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">(Please do not misinterpret the above paragraph to mean that minorities at NCF are somehow 'less Black' or 'less Asian' or 'less Latino.' I am simply acknowledging the fact that attending NCF will never be the same as attending their culturally specific churches. So, when people come to NCF they are making a conscious decision to leave behind their comfort zone in order to participate in a multi-cultural environment.)&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\"><em style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</em>Finally, there are people in our church who are Anglo. These people are from European ancestry, speak English, and come from families who have been in the US for several generations. These people are very comfortable in most contexts in St. Louis (employment, shopping, eating out, going to ball games, etc.) because their culture is the dominant culture here. Many of us take for granted that the Anglo way of life is the 'normal' way of living in St. Louis. As a result, many of these people have not had to sacrifice&nbsp;<em style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">any</em>&nbsp;of their culture to live in St. Louis and have had to sacrifice very little of their culture to go to NCF.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">Bearing all of that in mind, here is the point of all of this. Sometimes people have made comments like this, \"If we are supposed to be multi-cultural, then shouldn't we try to music in the style of our European heritages as well?\" I would say, 'No!' Why? ? If we were all starting out from the same position I would say, 'Yes', but the fact is that Anglos have given up so little in comparison. If Anglos are going to reach out in love to our siblings from other cultures, to be incarnational in our ministry, to lay down our lives as living sacrifices to the Lord, we have to recognize that our siblings who are minorities have given up a lot to leave their cultural enclaves to worship with us and our siblings who are immigrants have given up almost everything in order to live in the US. How much should we be willing to sacrifice in the name of showing love to each other? Jesus gave up everything for us, even his life. In the same way that Jesus became a baby in the Jewish context, we have to relate with different cultures as an infant, with humility and a sponge-like eagerness to learn.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px; padding: 0px;\">In the end,&nbsp;<strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">New City Fellowship must become a 150% church</strong>. We begin to share our cultures in a way that the natural and comfortable culture here becomes one where different cultures are allowed affect the larger church culture. Our children will grow up singing, \"Oshe Baba Oluwa, Oshe\" and learning conversational Spanish. They will treasure African-American spirituals as well as Presbyterian hymns as their tradition. NCF will become a unique culture that begins to affect the greater culture of St. Louis, the PCA, and the heritage of the generations who will come after us.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

When Jesus returns we will finally see this city perfected, the way it was meant to be. But even now we see vivid glimpses of it in our local congregations. In cities around the world, believers are joining hands across cultural barriers and lifting their voices together in praise of their Savior.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMany musicians leading this worship have been trained at New City Fellowship. This site hopes to further extend this movement, offering music, video, instruction,  and reflection for those who want to take part in the vision of cross cultural worship.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLike the New City congregations that support us, we are passionate about the Biblical view of racial reconciliation through Christ. Yet we recognize the difficultly of cross-cultural ministry. Our unique histories and dreams, beliefs and biases, images and idioms, often seem at odds. But through the Lord our different lives interlock. In Christ we find the places where the pieces bind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA pastor's gracious words or a deacon's loving deeds, in their own way, can help to heal racial fallout. Likewise, a musician's songs of praise can unite peoples who were once divided. The challenge of the cross-cultural worship leader is to search out the cultural angles that connect, the grooves that go together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class='pagename'>History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJames Ward, Music Director at New City Fellowship in Chattanooga, has found that uniting diverse cultures in praise requires working the middle ground between musical heritages. While studying music at Covenant College in the late sixties, Jim began leading Sunday worship at the downtown Chattanooga ministry that would eventually become New City Fellowship. Backed by a team of like-minded musicians, he searched for a musical language to express the new ministry's cross-cultural vision. Though he had grown up playing European Protestant hymns in white Presbyterian churches, he began to visit local black churches and black choir concerts. He wanted to find the places where the two traditions met. \u201cWe were trying to create a language of praise that didn't come from the extremes of white culture or black culture,\u201d says Jim.  \u201cWe wanted it to come from a common ground: hymns that both blacks and whites knew. By visiting black churches, we saw the raw energy and identity of the worshippers with specific songs and forms.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he turned to the Trinity Hymnal, and to contemporary Presbyterian worship songs, Jim found few hymns that black Protestant Christians had embraced. At the same time, he found few modern Gospel songs that were being sung by white Protestant Christians. So he mined deeper into the Church's musical history in search of material. In the rich store of nineteenth century British and American Gospel songs he found hymns that were dear to both white and black Christians.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs he was building his repertoire of cross-cultural praise songs, Jim also developed his ability to synthesize the distinctive worship styles of the two different traditions. If you were to step inside the sanctuary of New City Fellowship this Sunday during praise time, you might hear his band playing \u201cIn Christ Alone,\u201d a Townend-Getty hymn in the tradition of great nineteenth century songwriters like Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley. Though it is typically sung in a Celtic style, his band sings the hymn in the three part harmony common in black Gospel. They also add grand breaks and accents that reference the dramatic gestures of Gospel music. \u201cCeltic music wouldn't do it like that, and white churches wouldn't do it like that,\u201d he says, \u201cbut at a church where we have blended cultures, an impassioned delivery of a specifically white song is very helpful for bringing the congregation together.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs in any cross-cultural ministry,  unity doesn't come naturally. Even after carefully choosing his songs and molding their styles, Jim must persuade his congregation that unfamiliar music can be a part of their own heart language. When introducing a black Gospel song to his congregation, he will give instruction on how to sing along to its melody and clap to its rhythm. In the same way, traditional European hymns like \u201cBeneath the Cross of Jesus\u201d are unfamiliar to some African American worshippers, and must be introduced inclusively. He will also encourage reluctant white worshippers to step outside their own cultural comfort zones and engage the song in new ways. Both black and white members are given a similar nudge when he introduces a Spanish song into Sunday morning worship. In this case, he or one of his singers will usually introduce the song with a brief Spanish-to-English translation. When leading a diverse crowd in worship, thoughtful presentation is as important as the songs themselves.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThese are just some of the tools that Jim has developed over 30 years of leading worship at New City Fellowship. These are the tools that many have carried away from their time in training here. This website is another means of spreading this wealth, encouraging musicians and worship leaders across the country with the experience and legacy of New City music. \r\n</p>", "slug": "about"}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "content.page", "fields": {"subtitle": null, "standalone": false, "heroshot": null, "title": null, "content": null, "slug": "blog"}}, {"pk": 9, "model": "content.page", "fields": {"subtitle": "July 23-26 | St. Louis, MO", "standalone": true, "heroshot": null, "title": "2015 Conference", "content": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Introduction | <a href=\"/conference-registration/\">Registration</a> | <a href=\"/conference-participants/\">Plenary Speakers &amp; Breakout Sessions</a> | <a href=\"/conference-schedule/\">Schedule</a> | <a href=\"/conference-resources/\">Resources</a></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/media/ext/filebrowser/ncmc_2015_banner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"180\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Music for the Healing of the Nations</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><em>\"Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city.

It&rsquo;s best to not read my cultural values into another community&rsquo;s expressions of worship but indstead, ask them to interpret its meaning.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .5in;\">We first learned the song in Yoruba, French and English. Eventually, some of our Liberian folks translated it into Grabo. Then one weekend, a retired missionary who had served for years in Hong Kong suggested that this song would work great in Chinese, so we added that verse in the next time. This song is incredibly flexible! There is really no limit to the number of languages that can be added.

I can see that problem and relate to it, but I was struck at our conference with how many people were there who HAD been mentored and who were following in their mentor's footsteps. I talked with so many people who I had grown up with or had seen come-of-age at New City Fellowship who were now in active leadership roles in other ministries. It made me thankful for the grace of God working in my life to provide me with mentors who have shaped me, and it made me ask myself who is being mentored by me right now.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New City Fellowship is not the inventor or patent-holder of reconciliation, justice or the kingdom.</strong> We can get myopic in our circles about what NCF is doing. We can loose sight of the big picture of how the Spirit of God moves across the face of the earth in the hearts of people all over the world. The conference over and over again reveals to me how small I am in the movement of the kingdom and also how powerful the undercurrent of the kingdom is in the church. I was so glad to meet other Christian musicians who are wrestling with the same questions and desires that I am and who came to those conclusions from entirely different experiences.  It reveals that there is some unseen personality behind all this guiding and directing the development of the church.</p>\r\n<p><strong>There's too much good music out there.</strong> So many songs, so little time. (The same can be said for new books).</p>\r\n<p><strong>God likes to spread his gifted people around. </strong>I met and played with so many skilled musicians. It makes me feel a little sad that we can't all be together in one church to really have a \"Dream Team\" group of musicians. Of course, I know that if we did that, it would greatly reduce our effectiveness as church musicians. The kingdom calls us to \"spread our gifts abroad\" and not to consolidate them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>There's a deep thirst in the church for songs that tell the full gospel in a musical language that invites us to sing.&nbsp;</strong>I wrote a theme song for the conference and it's reception by the folks there FAR exceeded my expectations. I think that it tapped in on the need for songs to express aspects of the gospel that are missing from the mainstream.

Our church has had a more vibrant relationship to Latinos in the past. Mostly through some leadership changes about 8 years ago and subsequently neglecting to intentionally invest in these relationships as we put more attention into our ministry with Congolese refugees, we have lost ground on this particular work of reconciliation. However, we have <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NewCityHouseChurchEnEspanol\">recently re-booted</a> the work through the addition of pastor Jim Ward (no-relation), a missionary to Peru (and killer musician) who has relocated to St. Louis. So this weekend, we are going to sing all Spanish songs.</p>\r\n<p>So where do we get Spanish tunes for worship? We have a collection of &ldquo;oldies&rdquo; that were part of our repertoire in the 90&prime;s which fell out of use. A lot of these are Vineyard, Integrity or Maranatha tunes that have been translated into Spanish. This week, we&rsquo;re going to be singing several of these which include:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Grande Y Fuerte Es El&rdquo; aka &ldquo;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/66665/great-and-mighty-is-he\">Great and Mighty Is He</a>&rdquo; by Todd Pettygrove</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/5812233/el-espiritu-del-santo-dios\">El Esp&iacute;&shy;ritu Del Santo Dios</a>&rdquo; aka &ldquo;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/1025959/spirit-of-the-sovereign-lord\">Spirit of the Sovereign Lord</a>&rdquo; by Andy Park (an excellent setting of Isaiah 61)</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/5524521/cambia-mi-corazon\">Cambia Mi Coraz&oacute;n</a>&rdquo; aka &ldquo;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/1565/change-my-heart-oh-god\">Change My Heart Oh God</a>&rdquo; by Eddie Espinosa</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Es Tu Sangre&rdquo; aka &ldquo;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/59287/its-your-blood\">It&rsquo;s Your Blood</a>&rdquo; by Michael Christ</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re also singing some songs that have come from less familiar &nbsp;sources (to &ldquo;gringos&rdquo;):</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/ETyTpvsFclY\">T&uacute; Nos Creaste</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Jes&uacute;s Adri&aacute;n Romero</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/4234142/te-alabare-mi-buen-jesus\">Te Alabar&eacute; Mi Buen Jes&uacute;s</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Espinosa, Emmanuel</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/S0db7N__174\">Alegr&iacute;a</a>&nbsp;by &nbsp;Steve Coronado (as preformed by Salvador. I can honestly say without exaggeration that this is one of my most favorite worship songs ever!)</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing this weekend, but there are a couple of other resources you can check out if you need more ideas:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://store.augsburgfortress.org/store/category/257616/Libro-de-Liturgia-y-C-ntico\">Libro de Liturg&iacute;a y C&aacute;ntico</a>&nbsp;&ndash; is an excellent hymnal for Spanish worship done by the ELCA.</p>\r\n<p>A few artists you should check out on Spotify:&nbsp;Jes&uacute;s Adri&aacute;n Romero, Marcos Witt, Salvador, and Danilo Montero. (I made&nbsp;<a href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/kirkwardmusic/playlist/5DDFj9SttfZphvEoCnWf9c\">a playlist</a>&nbsp;you can check out.)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sovereigngracemusic.org/\">Sovereign Grace Music</a>&nbsp;has recorded several Spanish worship CDs. We use a tune from All&iacute; en la Cruz called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sovereigngracemusic.org/Songs/Somos_Tus_Hijos/3\">Somos Tus Hijos.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p>If you already have a subscription to CCLI&rsquo;s resource website,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/\">SongSelect</a>, you have acess to a TON of Spanish songs with lyrics, chords, and lead sheets! What they lack is an easy way to filter the songs so that you can get only the Spanish tunes. I had to use a publisher filter like for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/search/results?SearchTerm=CanZion\">CanZion</a>&nbsp;or a composers name, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/search/author?Authors=4294895597&amp;Sorting=Popularity\">Emmanuel Espinosa</a>&nbsp;to see what was there. However, I recently discoved that you can find a lot of the top 100 tunes like say,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/4591782/mighty-to-save\">Mighty To Save</a>, translated into Spanish (<a href=\"https://us.songselect.com/songs/5778999/solo-dios-puede-salvar\">S&oacute;lo Dios Puede Salvar</a>) with lead sheets there as well!
